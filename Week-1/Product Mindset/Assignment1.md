Smarto adding Jamboard feature for its customers

Smarto’s Jamboard feature will enable the users to share a common Digital Whiteboard with the students to sketch their ideas.

Smarto is excited to announce the addition of digital whiteboard on top of the existing virtual classes. This will help the schools and institutions to run the classroom without worrying about any physical board during the pandemic. Also the teachers don’t have to worry about the laptop’s or mobile’s camera or if the student can see the content on the board clearly. At the same time it will be easier for the students to understand time. Also if any student is absent he/she can refer to the content of the Jamboard later. This will improve the teaching experience of the teachers as well as the learning experience for the students.

The board is the widely-used tool of ‘visual education’ enabling the teacher to provide an entire class a common visual experience to enhance the vocal experience of a lecture. The pandemic has locked us in our homes and it is difficult to arrange a board at home for every teacher. Even if some arrange the board, the teachers have to align the camera of the laptop or mobile  so that the board is properly visible to the class. This is a very tiresome task. Also, if the laptops camera is not good enough this creates a bad experience for the students. From the students side the content of the board are lost as soon as the session is over.

Digital board creates a hassle-free experience for the teachers. They can create a similar ‘visual education’ experience using the Digital board. Also, the teachers can write and draw using mouse, trackpad and stylus. One can drag and resize text and images. Students gets real time update. One and zoom in for clarity. Some basic shapes and colourful pens are already present to save time and create a wonderful experience. The content will also be available in Smarto’s dashboard for later reference if someone have missed the session. This will increase the collaboration among the teachers and students.
